DJ AM (A. M. Goldstein; March 30, 1973 ¨C August 28, 2009) was an American disc jockey (DJ). Obsessed with deejaying as a child, Goldstein developed a drug addiction as a teenager and was sent to the controversial rehabilitation center Straight, Incorporated. His drug problems worsened until a failed suicide attempt in 1997. He became sober, and later sponsored other addicts through Alcoholics Anonymous. He began deejaying and joined the band Crazy Town in 1999 before focusing on a career as a solo DJ. In 2006, he accepted a million-dollar contract to perform weekly at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas. In 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker formed the duo TRV$DJAM. They were the only two survivors of a Learjet 60 crash later that year. Goldstein hosted the 2009 drug intervention television series Gone Too Far, and appeared to be struggling with his addiction during filming. In August 2009, he was found dead from a drug overdose. The DJ AM Memorial Fund was launched that year for people recovering from drug addiction.
